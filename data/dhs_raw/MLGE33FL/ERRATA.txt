Dear DHS GPS Data User,

We are contacting you because you downloaded a previous version of the Mali 1996 DHS GPS data.

The following cluster's urban_rural values have been changed from rural to urban:

These issues have been resolved in the newly issued data file MLGE33FL. Please use these data for any analyses and disregard the previous data file.  
We apologize for any confusion this may cause you.
