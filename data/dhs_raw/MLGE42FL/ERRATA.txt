The previous version of the Mali 2001 DHS GPS data named MLGE41FL had 1 cluster with 
incorrect urban/rural definition.   

The following cluster's urban_rural values have been changed from rural to urban: 335

These issues have been resolved in the newly issued data file MLGE42FL.  Please use these data 
for any analyses and disregard the previous data file.  We apologize for any confusion this may 
cause you.
